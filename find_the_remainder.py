# purpose of the code is to find the remainder if a number a is divided by another number b
print("to divide a number a by other number b and hence find remainder of it")
a=int(input("enter  value of the number a which should be the numerator "))
b=int(input("enter the value of b which would be denominator"))
print("the remainder of ",a,"/",b,"is :",a%b)
